      There can be several reasons why the first attempt to log in fails but the second attempt works. One possible reason could be that the authentication credentials are not properly validated and stored during the first attempt. This could happen if there is a problem with the configuration of the authentication provider or if there is an issue with the login form submission.

      Another possible reason could be related to the authentication mechanism used by Spring Security. For example, if a user tries to log in with an incorrect password or username, Spring Security might need to perform additional checks to validate the user's identity. This could result in a delay or error in the authentication process, which might cause the login to fail on the first attempt but succeed on subsequent attempts.

      To troubleshoot this issue, you can check the Spring Security configuration and the authentication provider to ensure that they are properly configured. You can also review the login form submission process to see if there are any issues with the way the user's credentials are being submitted. Additionally, you can check the authentication logs to see if there are any errors or issues that are preventing the authentication process from completing successfully on the first attempt.
